# Raft-Implementation

## About the project
- This repository contains a simple [RAFT](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) concensus algorithm implemented as part of the [CSE530](https://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE530) course offered at IIIT-D.
- Team Members: Aditya Ahuja, Deeptanshu Barman, Keshav Rajput

## Introduction
- **Raft** is a consensus algorithm designed to be easy to understand. Raft divides time into terms, and each term begins with an election to select a leader. The leader manages the replication of the log entries to the other servers and ensures a high degree of consistency.
- This implementation of RAFT also employs leader lease for optimized read only queries. Leases can be considered as tokens that are valid for a certain period of time, known as lease duration. A node can serve read and write requests from the client if and only if the node has this valid token/lease.

## Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) 
- Raft servers communicate using remote procedure calls (RPCs), and the basic consensus algorithm requires only two types of RPCs. 
- **RequestVote** RPCs are initiated by candidates during elections.
- **AppendEntries** RPCs are initiated by leaders to replicate log entries and to provide a form of heartbeat.
- For this project, [**gRPC**](https://grpc.io) has been used to facilitate RPC functionality.
- The RPCs utilized in this project are detailed in the below figure (Note: The RPCs contain slight modifications to incorporate the leader lease functionality):
